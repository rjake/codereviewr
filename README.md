# codeReviewR

I've been working on code to analyze code. The idea is that it scans an R or Rmd file and visualizes all of the object assignments (x-axis), determines what they do (y-axis), and shows how they relate to each other. Ideally, this would highlight opportunities to restructure or consolidate code. I hope to make it interactive and accessible in the future via shiny or flexdashboard


## To-Do:

* Assignments in `if ()` statements
